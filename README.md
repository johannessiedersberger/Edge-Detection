# Edge-Detection
This application is used for calculating the distances between all edges in a certain row
# Features
- Distance Calculation: Counting every pixel between an Edge in a ceartain row. An Edge is recognizable because of its higher grey-scale values.
- Diagramm: This diagramm shows the grey-scale values (0-255) of the selected line
- Distances Box: The calculated distances are shown in the box
