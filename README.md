# Edge-Detection
This application is used for calculating the distances between all edges in a certain row
### Start Image
We use this image as an example <br />

### Calculating Button
Input the Line that you want to use for the calculation into the text field. Than press the calculate button to calculate the distances between the edges <br />
### Distance Calculation
To calculate the distances I count the pixels between every edge. An Edge is recognizable because of its higher color-values.
### Diagramm
This diagramm shows the grey-scale values (0-255) of the selected line <br />
### The Selected Line
This is the line that we selected to calculate the distances between the edges <br />
### End Image
Here i applied the algorithm that makes the edges visible

### Distances Box
The calculated distances are shown here <br />
