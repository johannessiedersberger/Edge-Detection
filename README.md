# Edge-Detection
This application is used for calculating the distances between all edges in a certain row
### Start Image
We use this image as an example <br />

### Distance Calculation
To calculate the distances I count the pixels between every edge. An Edge is recognizable because of its higher grey-scale values.
### Diagramm
This diagramm shows the grey-scale values (0-255) of the selected line <br />
### Distances Box
The calculated distances are shown in the box <br />
### End Image
Here i applied the [algorithm](https://github.com/johannessiedersberger/Edge-Detection/blob/master/EdgeDetection/EdgeDetection/Edge/EdgeDetection.cs)
that makes the edges visible
